       Password Attacks<br>
      With the right password, a cyber-attacker has access to a wealth of information. Social engineering is a type of
      password attack that Data Insider defines as “a strategy cyber attackers use that relies heavily on human
      interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices.” Other types of password
      attacks include accessing a password database or outright guessing.
<br><br>
       Drive-by attack<br>
      Drive-by download attacks are a common method of spreading malware. Hackers look for insecure websites and plant a
      malicious script into HTTP or PHP code on one of the pages. This script might install malware directly onto the
      computer of someone who visits the site, or it might re-direct the victim to a site controlled by the hackers.
      Drive-by downloads can happen when visiting a website or viewing an email message or a pop-up window. Unlike many
      other types of cyber security attacks, a drive-by doesn’t rely on a user to do anything to actively enable the
      attack — you don’t have to click a download button or open a malicious email attachment to become infected. A
      drive-by download can take advantage of an app, operating system or web browser that contains security flaws due
      to unsuccessful updates or lack of updates.
<br><br>
       Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack<br>
      XSS attacks use third-party web resources to run scripts in the victim’s web browser or scriptable application.
      Specifically, the attacker injects a payload with malicious JavaScript into a website’s database. When the victim
      requests a page from the website, the website transmits the page, with the attacker’s payload as part of the HTML
      body, to the victim’s browser, which executes the malicious script. For example, it might send the victim’s cookie
      to the attacker’s server, and the attacker can extract it and use it for session hijacking. The most dangerous
      consequences occur when XSS is used to exploit additional vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can enable an
      attacker to not only steal cookies, but also log key strokes, capture screenshots, discover and collect network
      information, and remotely access and control the victim’s machine.
<br><br>
       Eavesdropping attack<br>
      Eavesdropping attacks occur through the interception of network traffic. By eavesdropping, an attacker can obtain
      passwords, credit card numbers and other confidential information that a user might be sending over the network.
      Eavesdropping can be passive or active:
      Passive eavesdropping — A hacker detects the information by listening to the message transmission in the network.
      Active eavesdropping — A hacker actively grabs the information by disguising himself as friendly unit and by
      sending queries to transmitters. This is called probing, scanning or tampering.
    <br><br>
       Birthday attack<br>
      Birthday attacks are made against hash algorithms that are used to verify the integrity of a message, software or
      digital signature. A message processed by a hash function produces a message digest (MD) of fixed length,
      independent of the length of the input message; this MD uniquely characterizes the message. The birthday attack
      refers to the probability of finding two random messages that generate the same MD when processed by a hash
      function. If an attacker calculates same MD for his message as the user has, he can safely replace the user’s
      message with his, and the receiver will not be able to detect the replacement even if he compares MDs.
