          What is cyber security<br><br>
          Cyber security professionals continually defend computer systems against different types of cyber threats.
          Cyber-attacks hit businesses and private systems every day, and the variety of attacks has increased quickly.
          According to former Cisco CEO John Chambers, “There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked,
          and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.”<br>
          <br>What Is a Cyber Security Threat?<br><br>
          A cyber security threat refers to any possible malicious attack that seeks to unlawfully access data disrupt
          digital operations or damage information. Cyber threats can originate from various actors, including corporate
          spies, activists, terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, criminal organizations, lone hackers and
          disgruntled employees.
