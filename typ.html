       Malware<br>
      Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransom ware, viruses and worms. Malware is activated when a user
      clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software. Malicious software can be
      described as unwanted software that is installed in your system without your consent. It can attach itself to
      legitimate code and propagate; it can lurk in useful applications or replicate itself across the Internet.
      <br><br> Denial of Service<br>
      A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber-attack that floods a computer or network so it can’t respond to
      requests. A distributed DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates from a computer network. Cyber
      attackers often use a flood attack to disrupt the “handshake” process and carry out DoS. Several other techniques
      may be used, and some cyber attackers use the time that a network is disabled to launch other attacks. A botnet is
      a type of DDoS in which millions of systems can be infected with malware and controlled by a hacker, according to
      Jeff Melnick of Netwrix, an information technology security software company. Botnets, sometimes called zombie
      systems, target and overwhelm a target’s processing capabilities. Botnets are in different geographic locations
      and hard to trace.<br><br>
       Man in the Middle<br>
      A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. After
      interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco. MITM attacks often occur when a
      visitor uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers insert themselves between the visitor and the network,
      and then use malware to install software and use data maliciously.<br><br>
       Phishing<br>
      Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it and carrying out
      the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit
      card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine,” Cisco reports.<br><br>
       SQL Injection<br>
      A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a type of cyber-attack that results from inserting malicious code
      into a server that uses SQL. When infected, the server releases information. Submitting the malicious code can be
      as simple as entering it into a vulnerable website search box.
